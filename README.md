The King James Holy Bible in 1189 Lyric format files (*.lrc)

This code generates LRC text files to sit alongside KJV audio files
for scripture display while corresponding sound plays in your favorite
player.  I use MythMusic of MythTV.  Other options might be found at:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)#Support

Grab a release file from github to get a full set of .lrc files for
your .mp3 files, see INSTALL options below.

These .lrc files distribute the time of the audio recording across the
"reading syllables" of the text.  This yields a display within a line
or two of the sound most of the time.  The sound and text occasionally
drift by up to 5 lines so displaying 11 or more lines of context is
recommended.

"Reading syllables" are the syllables of the words plus:

* two syllables before and after chapter headers: { }
* two syllables for sentence ending punctuation: . ?
* one syllable for pause punctuation: , ; :
* one syllable for blank line paragraph separator

This yields a better timing than bytes, words or lines.


# INSTALLATION

Simply copy the DIR/*.lrc files to the location of matching *.mp3
files.  Or, copy those matching *.mp3 to the given DIR here.  AS/OF
the given dates, these options worked for me.

DIR:	AS/
ARTIST:	Alexander Scourby
YEAR:	1953
SOURCE:	https://earnestlycontendingforthefaith.com/ListenToTheKingJamesBible.html
AS/OF:	2024
NOTE:	the original KJV audio was on 169 LP records!

DIR:	DW/
ARTIST:	Rev Dan Wagner
YEAR:	1999
SOURCE:	https://www.audiotreasure.com/AT_KJVA.htm
AS/OF:	2022
NOTE:	voice only, slower

DIR:	SJ/
ARTIST:	Stephen Johnston
YEAR:	1999
SOURCE:	https://www.audiotreasure.com/indexKJV.htm
AS/OF:	2022
NOTE:	soft music, faster

DIR:	emacs/
ARTIST:	Timothy D Witham
YEAR:	2005
SOURCE:	./site-lisp/kjv-mode.el ./bin/kjvmp3
AS/OF:	2025
NOTE:	No .lrc at all but rather a scripture reading mode for Emacs


# EMACS

If you use emacs, copy site-lisp/kjv-mode.el to any directory on your
emacs load-path and add something like this to ~/.emacs

   (autoload 'kjv-mode "kjv-mode" nil t)

Now M-x find-file on ./kjv.txt should invoke kjv-mode for reading the
Bible in emacs.  See C-h m for mode documentation.

symlink the directory of your *.mp3 to ~/.kjv, something like:

	ln -s /usr/local/share/doc/KJV/AS ~/.kjv

then copy bin/kjvmp3 to your $PATH for audio playback in emacs.


# Thoughts on .mp3 Bible Chapter METADATA

How do you keep track of 1189 chapters in your audio player?  DW and
SJ used filenames that sort in order via chapter number prefixes, so
that might be sufficient.  My copy of AS however did not do this so an
alphabetical sort of the files is not in biblical order.

What I do in either case is use a tool like puddletag (or mp3tag) to
give all files one Album name, like KJV-AS, and Artist and year.  Then
I assign 66 Disc numbers to the 66 books in order.  Then I assign the
chapters of the books as Track numbers of the Disc.  My player sorts
albums by disc and track, so this keeps the whole Bible in order no
matter the file names.

However, Disc can have no more than 99 tracks so Psalms can't fit in a
single Disc.  The solution is to combine Psalms and Proverbs into two
Discs and split them in half as follows:

* Psalm 1-90 stay on Disc 19
* Psalm 91-150 are reassigned to Disc 20 and Track 1-60
* Proverbs 1-31 stay on Disc 20 but move to Track 61-91

This way everything is in order and in 66 Discs matching 66 books,
with the above exceptions in only 2 books.  Psalms chapters on Disc 20
are 90 more than their track number while Proverbs are 60 less.


# HOW TO [RE]GENERATE .lrc files for .mp3 files

These .lrc files were generated from the source AS/OF dates above.  If
the source audio changes, or to apply to different audio, the code can
be re-run against new .mp3 content.  This will require:

* the SWORD project and its diatheke command
* perl to run my code in bin/
* exiftool to measure .mp3 audio length
* make to fully automate the process from my Makefile

See Makefile to see the details of how the files are generated:

1. bin/kjv generates kjv.txt from https://crosswire.org/ 's SWORD
project, converting to a 75 column UTF-8 text format that still
includes [italics], paragraphs and "Words of Christ".

2. bin/kjvmp3 -s is used to measure words and syllables of each line
and chapter, see kjv-syb.txt

3. bin/kjvmp3 -r is used to generate a 365 day reading schedule aiming
for similar syllables per day while breaking only between chapters,
see yearstat.txt.

4. bin/kjvmp3 -a is used to annotate the reading schedule into the
chapter headers, see kjv.txt

5. bin/kjvmp3 -l is used to generate a .lrc file per .mp3, 1189 total
